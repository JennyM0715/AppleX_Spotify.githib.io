# Summary
My first attempt at making an Apple iPhone X front layout. I don't own an Apple iPhone, I always had andriod so I am hoping this is close enought based off of looking at images on what they look like. The first iphone layout is the front with the unlock image ontop of the time and you see the two shortcuts on the bottom section of the iphone. The second iphone is just a layout of Spotify.

The biggest stuggle for this project was creating the iphone frame and the speaker/mic & front-camera layout. I had to use CSS properties that I didn't have a lot of familiarity with such as box-shadow, transform, border-radius, and position. The different values that can be used for the box-shadow property and its syntax was difficult for me to get use to but tested it out a lot to see which values for the property worked best. It was a bunch of trial and errors for box-shadow property and using the linear-gradient.

I am still unfamiliar with using linear-gradient for the background property but I am getting use to it since I found websites that generate the linear-gradient colors for you already which I listed below. There is also using "hsl", "rgb(x,x,x)", and "rgba(x,x,x,x)".

Note: I don't own any of the Spotify images that were used for this layout. This is purely for educational purposes.
